## Hey there! Welcome to my Flutter Playground!

This project is my laboratory of experiments in flutter.
Enjoy!

=> List of challanges:

[1. Recursive function algorithm](https://github.com/Bru-marques/flutter_masterclass/blob/main/assets/images/mockups/01_recursive_function_algorithm.png)

[2. Role of 3 algorithm](https://github.com/Bru-marques/flutter_masterclass/blob/main/assets/images/mockups/02_role_of_3_algorithm.png)

[3. Credt Card validator algorithm](https://github.com/Bru-marques/flutter_masterclass/blob/main/assets/images/mockups/03_credit_card_validator_algorithm.png)
